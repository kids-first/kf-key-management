# Kids First Key Management Lambdas

AWS Lambda functions for storing user api tokens from third party services.

Additionally provides a Lambda service to work as a proxy 

## Lambda Setup

The following environment variables are referenced in the code:

| Variable Name        | Value         |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| `kms` | AWS KMS encryption key ID - used to encrypt/decrypt secrets before storage in dynamo DB. |
| `ego_public` | Public Key of the ego instance that will be used to validate JWT tokens provided for user identification. |
| `cavatica_root` | (*CavaticaProxy* only) URL to be used for Cavatica API. In Production: `https://cavatica-api.sbgenomics.com/v2` |
 
In *Basic settings* of the Lambda configuration, set Memory to 1024 and timeout to 15+ seconds. Otherwise the encryption/decryption steps will fail.


## Methods

 * [Get Secret](#get-secret)
 * [Put Secret](#put-secret)
 * [Delete Secret](#delete-secret)
 * [Cavatica Proxy](#cavatica-proxy)

All methods require a JWT in the Authorization header which can be verified with the public key provided in the configuration. Without a valid token the request will be rejected. The UserID is taken from the `sub` field of the JWT.
